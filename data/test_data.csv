User: My laptop keeps overheating and shutting down while I'm gaming. What could be causing this and how can I fix it?
<response>
The overheating issue during gaming is likely due to intensive GPU and CPU usage combined with insufficient cooling. Here are several steps to address this:

Clean your laptop's vents and fans using compressed air to remove dust buildup. Do this carefully to avoid damaging internal components.
Check your laptop's positioning - ensure it's on a hard, flat surface that allows proper airflow. Using a cooling pad can significantly improve ventilation.
Monitor your system temperatures using software like MSI Afterburner or Core Temp. Normal gaming temperatures should stay below 85°C (185°F).
Adjust your game settings to reduce the load on your system:

Lower graphics quality settings
Cap your frame rate
Reduce resolution if necessary


Consider repasting your CPU/GPU if your laptop is more than 2 years old. Thermal paste degrades over time, reducing cooling efficiency.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, you may need professional servicing to check for hardware problems or cooling system failures.

"Here is a news article :
MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Drivers who were on the Minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. ""The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down,"" survivor Gary Babineau told CNN. ""I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down."" He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. ""I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones."" Watch a driver describe his narrow escape » . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. ""I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling,"" Babineau said. ""It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies."" Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. ""I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall,"" he said. ""So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. ""I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos."" He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries. See rescuers clamber over rubble » . Babineau said he had no rescue training. ""I just knew what I had to do at the moment."" Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. ""You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice,"" Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. ""I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car,"" she told AP. ""It's really very surreal."" Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: ""On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. ""My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive."" See and hear eyewitness accounts » . Bernie Toivonen told CNN's ""American Morning"" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. ""I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die,"" he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, ""I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' "" he said. E-mail to a friend .

"Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Passage: The 1996 campaign was the Suns first losing year in the SAL. First basemen Mike Whitlock led the team in home runs (20) and RBI (91) with a .252 batting average while drawing a franchise record 108 walks. He did this in 131 games at the age of 19, yet never played a game in the major leagues. Another player who displayed power was Craig Wilson (first baseman). Wilson hit 11 home runs with 70 RBI while maintaining a .261 batting average. Craig Stone returned from the 1995 squad, batting .310 with 10 home runs and 35 RBI in 56 games. Mike Johnson (1990s pitcher) won a staff-leading 11 games and also had a team-leading total of 162.2 innings pitched. He made his major league debut a season later with the Baltimore Orioles. Tom Davey won 10 games and had a 3.87 ERA in 26 starts.

"In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"In this task, you are presented with a term, a description of the term, and an expected answer ('yes' or 'no'). You should write a yes-no question about the given term such that the answer is the one provided to you (i.e., If the answer is ""No"", you should ask a question that its answer would be ""No"", and if the answer is ""Yes"", you should ask a question that its answer is ""Yes"". ). The question should have a definitive answer (as opposed to ambiguous or subjective questions, e.g., Is Batman a good movie?). Create a question such that its answer can not be found easily on a single web page (e.g., mentioned in a Wikipedia page). This can be accomplished if answering the question requires more than one fact (facts = statements that can be found on a Wikipedia page or Google).  For example, answering the question 'did Aristotle use a laptop?', one needs the know about the invention of the laptop and the death of Aristotle. Avoid questions should not just compare the properties of objects (e.g., Is a door bigger than an elephant?) or those that refer to details in the given description.

 Here are the defications of each category: 
 1. majority: Describing the majority values (most or all) over one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 2. unique: Describing one unique row, regarding one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 3. Superlative: Describing the maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 4. Ordinal: Describing the n-th maximum or minimum value in a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 5. Comparative: Comparing two rows in the table, regarding their values in one column 
 6. Count: counting some rows in the table based on the values in one column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows 
 7. Aggregation: Describing the sum or average value over a column, with the scope of all table rows or a subset of rows. 
 Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command: 
 1. count: returns the number of rows in the view. 
 2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view. 
 3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row. 
 4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments. 
 5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column. 
 6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column. 
 7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column. 
 8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column. 
 9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal. 
 10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance. 
 11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument. 
 12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments.

"In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Passage: Following a close victory over the Chargers, the Steelers traveled to Ford Field for a Week 5 interconference duel with the 1-3 Detroit Lions.  Despite the Lions getting the opening score of the first quarter with a 46-yard field goal from kicker  Jason Hanson, Pittsburgh would answer with running back Rashard Mendenhall's 7-yard touchdown run.  Afterwards, Detroit closed out the opening period with Hanson making another 46-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Steelers would deliver a big strike with quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completing a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller.  Even though the Lions came right back with cornerback Williams James returning an interception 38&#160;yards for a touchdown, Pittsburgh effectively replied with Roethlisberger's 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Hines Ward. In the third quarter, the Steelers would add onto their lead as Roethlisberger threw to rookie wide receiver Mike Wallace on a 47-yard touchdown pass.  Detroit tried to rally in the fourth quarter as quarterback Daunte Culpepper found wide receiver Dennis Northcutt on a 25-yard touchdown pass, but Pittsburgh's defense made a crucial stand with three-straight sacks (courtesy of linebacker LaMarr Woodley, cornerback William Gay, and linebacker Lawrence Timmons), followed by cornerback Ike Taylor swatting away the Lions' last hope from a hail-mary pass. 
Question: How many touchdowns were scored in the second quarter?

"Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

"In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"In this task, you are presented with a term, a description of the term, and an expected answer ('yes' or 'no'). You should write a yes-no question about the given term such that the answer is the one provided to you (i.e., If the answer is ""No"", you should ask a question that its answer would be ""No"", and if the answer is ""Yes"", you should ask a question that its answer is ""Yes"". ). The question should have a definitive answer (as opposed to ambiguous or subjective questions, e.g., Is Batman a good movie?). Create a question such that its answer can not be found easily on a single web page (e.g., mentioned in a Wikipedia page). This can be accomplished if answering the question requires more than one fact (facts = statements that can be found on a Wikipedia page or Google).

"In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Passage: Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins.

 A question decomposition is a numbered list of operations that must be performed to answer the original question. Imagine explaining your question to a friendly droid by listing each action it should take in order for the question to be answered. Each step in our decomposition should refer to either an entity (known or unknown), a propery of an entity or a query operation (count, group, union, etc.)
 Here are the list of step templates and their description:
 Select: A select step is used to return a set of objects. There are no references to previous steps in a select step. template: Return [attributes]
 Filter: A filter step is used to return results from a previous step to which a certain condition applies. template: Return [#step] [condition]
 Project: A project step should return certain attributes of the results of a previous step. template: Return [attributes] of [#step]
 Aggregate: An aggregate step returns an aggregator function applied on a step's result. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step].
 Group: A group step is an aggregator applied on attributes. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step] for each [attribute]
 Superlative: A superlative step is used to return the result with a highest/lowest attribute among other results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [is] [highest / lowest]

To create such questions, here are some suggestions: A. What may (or may not) be the plausible reason for an event? B. What may (or may not) happen before (or after, or during) an event? C. What may (or may not) be a plausible fact about someone (or something)? D. What may (or may not) happen if an event happens (or did not happen)? You can also create other types of questions. DO NOT make your question answerable without looking at the context, or question of which the correct answer can be directly extracted from the context. DO NOT ask a question that requires very specialized knowledge that is not common sense. DO NOT ask too simple or too short questions. Your question must be related to the context and answerable with common sense. Try to add more variations and complexity to the questions.

I had a chemistry test coming up. I didn't do so well on the first one. Now is my chance to prove I can do well. I study for a week straight. 4+ hours every day. And i get a 65%. In the car, my dad asks about it. I say I got a 65, which was better than last time, and not an F but a D, and I got my last exam score (55%) replaced with this one. Dad asks what I have in thr class, and I say 75%.    Mom says ""you might want to rethink being a chem major if you can't do community college level chemistry."" I'm 17, in high school, and I'm going to a local community college through a program my school offers. She has already brought it up before, and I was really doubting myself. I just say ""haha yeah.."" because I don't really know what else to say. Its been hard motivating myself and finding a goal I want to achieve, but being a biochem major and getting my bachelors degree in Science is the one goal I've made for myself. Its what I've been working with in mind for the last 2 years at this college. I almost have my Associates. And now my mom is telling me I can't achieve my goal.     My dad says ""no no she can do it, it will take a little work, but she can do it. Everything takes work."" I don't say anything because I don't want my mom to keep going on about it. Last time she talked about this, I was in the car by myself with her, so I just had to sit and listen to her tell me I'm not good at chemistry, wasn't in high school, isn't now, and why do I want to be a chem major when I'm bad at chemistry. But I felt better about having my dad in the car because he usually says something when my mom goes too far with something.     She always used to ask me why I don't have any goals in life, why I don't care. Because whenever I have something I love doing or something I want to work towards, you always walk all over me and make me question whether or not I can do it, whether or not I can do anything.       When I was applying to universities, she said I could apply anywhere, that now was my time to start becoming more mature. She always goes on about how college is my time, my time to do what I want, be who I want to be, and how I can go anywhere.     I said I wanted to apply to UW Seattle.     Yes, perfect!     I guess I can apply to UW Tacoma too. No, you are not applying there!     Why not, it has a small school size which is what I want, it's still University of Washington thats the one school I have always dreamed of going to every since I was a kid.     Because, you are not applying there!!!    I want to apply to both UW's with dorms I've always wanted to go there, XXX (my boyfriend) is going there too!     You know you're not going to be with him when you're in college right, you're not going to be together very long, you know you're not getting married, right? You're going to meet so many new people in college, you think he's not going to meet any new people while he's in college? He's probably met people already (he's a college freshman this year).    She always asks if I have crushes on any of my male friends. Asks if I feel anything for them. If there's something between us. I don't understand why. She's not joking. She's being completely serious. It just makes me uncomfortable. And always makes comments about my boyfriend finding someone else to be with at work or at college.    As I was showing her my prom dress, she said,    Maybe you'll get to wear it in college, some guy might invite you out to a fancy event!    I'm going to prom with my boyfriend and I have never been more exited to go to a school event. I've never gone to school dances, events, anything. But my boyfriend wanted to share a special day with me, and that's what my mom had to say about it.     I wish she could recognize that I'm happy with him, and even though I know it may not last forever, I can hope it will and appreciate the present.

"For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"Determine if the provided SQL statement properly addresses the given question. Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Passage: After winning at home, the Steelers traveled to Cincinnati for Game 2 against the Bengals. Before the game started there were an altercation between the two teams during warmups. Vince Williams and Vontaze Burfict were in the center of the scuffle. The game began with a score on the very first drive, when DeAngelo Williams ran for a 1-yard TD for a 7-0 lead and would increase their lead in the 2nd quarter, when Chris Boswell went for 2 field goals:  From 42 and 47 yards out for 10-0 and 13-0 leads.  QB Andy Dalton would be knocked out of the game so backup QB AJ McCarron came in and threw his first career TD pass to A. J. Green from 66 yards out to make the score 13-7.  Boswell, however, wrapped up the scoring of the first half with another 47 yard field goal for a 16-7 lead at halftime.  In the third quarter, the Steelers went back to work as William Gay picked off AJ McCarron and returned it 23 yards for a TD for a 23-7 game.  Mike Nugent would kick a 46-yard field goal to make it 23-10.  The Steelers went back to work in the fourth quarter when Boswell kicked a 31-yard field goal for a 26-10 game.  The Bengals responded with Nugent kicking a 27-yard field goal for a 26-13 game.  Later on however, the Steelers would pretty much seal the game when Williams ran for another 1-yard TD for a 33-13 game.  The Bengals would wrap up the scoring of the game when McCarron found Rex Burkhead on a 5-yard pass for a 33-20 final score. With the win, the Steelers improved to 8-5.  The defense also stood out and continued their reign of sacks and takeaways with 3 each (picked off Dalton once, picked off McCarron twice).

"In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

Policy: This refers to a sentence proposing a specific course of action to be taken. It typically contains modal verbs like ""should"" and ""ought to"". It cannot be directly proved with objective evidence, and a proper type of support is a logical reason from which the proposition can be inferred.
Value: This refers to a sentence containing value judgments without making specific claims about what should be done (If so, then it is a Policy sentence.). Because of the subjectivity of value judgments, it cannot be proved directly with objective evidence.
Fact: This refers to an objective proposition expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. A Fact sentence has a truth value that can be verified with objective evidence that may be available at the time the claim is made; predictions about future are considered unverifiable.

Passage: Plague was one of the hazards of life in Britain from its dramatic appearance in 1348 with the Black Death. The Bills of Mortality began to be published regularly in 1603, in which year 33,347 deaths were recorded from plague. Between then and 1665, only four years had no recorded cases. In 1563, a thousand people were reportedly dying in London each week. In 1593, there were 15,003 deaths, 1625 saw 41,313 dead, between 1640 and 1646 came 11,000 deaths, culminating  in 3,597 for 1647. The 1625 outbreak was recorded at the time as the Great Plague, Until 1665, surpassed it. These official figures are likely to under-report actual numbers.

Passage: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.  Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.  The Texans would respond with fullback Vonta Leach getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Raiders would answer with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.  Houston would tie the game in the second quarter with kicker Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal. Oakland would take the lead in the third quarter with wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins catching a 29-yard touchdown pass from Russell, followed up by an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown.  The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal, yet the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt.

There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

"In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"In the following task, you are given a yes/no question, its answer, and additional information which includes a description of a key term in the question and several facts. Your task is to ""decompose the question""i.e. write the steps required to construct the given answer where each step is a question that can be answered using Wikipedia articles. To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. ""not_definitive_answer"" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.""incorrect_answer"" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question. Every question's answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition.

Policy: This refers to a sentence proposing a specific course of action to be taken. It typically contains modal verbs like ""should"" and ""ought to"". It cannot be directly proved with objective evidence, and a proper type of support is a logical reason from which the proposition can be inferred.
Value: This refers to a sentence containing value judgments without making specific claims about what should be done (If so, then it is a Policy sentence.). Because of the subjectivity of value judgments, it cannot be proved directly with objective evidence.
Fact: This refers to an objective proposition expressing or dealing with facts or conditions as perceived without distortion by personal feelings, prejudices, or interpretations. A Fact sentence has a truth value that can be verified with objective evidence that may be available at the time the claim is made; predictions about future are considered unverifiable.
Testimony: This refers to an objective sentence about the author's personal state or experience. Evidence for Testimony is not publicly available in most cases.

"In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Passage: Then, in 1544, five French galleys under Polin, including the superb Réale, accompanied Barbarossa's fleet, on a diplomatic mission to Suleiman. The French fleet accompanied Barbarossa during his attacks on the west coast of Italy on the way to Constantinople, as he laid waste to the cities of Porto Ercole, Giglio, Talamona, Lipari and took about 6,000 captives, but separated in Sicily from Barbarossa's fleet to continue alone to the Ottoman capital. Jerôme Maurand, a priest of Antibes who accompanied Polin and the Ottoman fleet in 1544, wrote a detailed account in Itinéraire d'Antibes à Constantinople. They arrived in Constantinople on 10 August 1544 to meet with Suleiman and give him an account of the campaign. Polin was back to Toulon on 2 October 1544.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

"Determine if the provided SQL statement properly addresses the given question. Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

The generated questions must require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. Try to use a variety of reasoning types in your questions (some of the sample reasoning types are illustrated in the 'positive examples' field) and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates). A span is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. In such questions, the answer spans are recommended to be five words. Questions with answer type ""number"", are expected to start with ""How many"". For instance, ""How long did an event last?"" can be phrased as ""How many years did an event last?"". To increase diversity, try to create more questions for which the answer will be multiple spans. Please create questions that require AT LEAST 2 arithmetic operations as illustrated in the 'positive examples' field. You are encouraged to try DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS of operations and not just limit to the combinations shown in those examples. The more challenging questions you create, the better it is.
Passage: In 1085, Guadalajara was retaken by the Christian forces of Alfonso VI . The chronicles say that the Christian army was led by Alvar Fanez de Minaya, one of the lieutenants  of El Cid. From 1085 until the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, the city suffered wars against the Almoravid and the Almohad Empires. In spite of the wars, the Christian population could definitely settle down in the area thanks to the repopulation with people from the North  who received their first fuero in 1133 from Alfonso VII.In 1219, the king Fernando III gave a new fuero to the city .During the reign of Alfonso X of Castile, the protection of the king allowed the city to develop its economy by protecting merchants and allowing markets.",https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.244/,,Human,

Passage: Hoping to rebound from their fourth-quarter collapse to the Panthers, the Vikings flew to Soldier Field to face Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears in a Week 16 rematch to conclude the 40th season of Monday Night Football. Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20-17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikes started to rally with running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run (with the extra point attempt blocked). The Bears increased their lead over the Vikings with Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark. The Vikings then closed out the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre firing a 6-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. An exciting fourth quarter ensued. The Vikings started out the quarter's scoring with kicker Ryan Longwell's 41-yard field goal, along with Adrian Peterson's second 1-yard TD run. The Bears then responded with Cutler firing a 20-yard TD pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett. The Vikings then completed the remarkable comeback with Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 6-yard TD pass on 4th-and-goal with 15 seconds left in regulation. The Bears then took a knee to force overtime. In overtime, the Bears won the toss and marched down the field, stopping at the 35-yard line. However, the potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt by Gould went wide right, giving the Vikings a chance to win. After an exchange of punts, the Vikings had the ball at the 26-yard line with 11 minutes left in the period. On the first play of scrimmage, Favre fired a screen pass to Peterson who caught it and went 16 yards, before being confronted by Hunter Hillenmeyer, who caused Peterson to fumble the ball, which was then recovered by Bears' linebacker Nick Roach. The Bears then won on Jay Cutler's game-winning 39-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Aromashodu. With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 11-4, they also surrendered homefield advantage to the Saints.

"In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

In 1974, at the Glensville Sanatorium in West Virginia, three deformed patients known as the Hillicker Brothers escape from their cells and release the other patients; together they massacre the orderlies and the doctors.Twenty-nine years later in 2003, nine Weston University students: Kenia (Jennifer Pudavick), Jenna (Terra Vnesa), Vincent (Sean Skene), Sara (Tenika Davis), Bridget (Kaitlyn Leeb), Kyle (Victor Zinck, Jr.), Claire (Samantha Kendrick), Daniel (Dean Armstrong) and Lauren (Ali Tataryn), are snowmobiling, on their way to their friend Porter's cabin in the mountains. However, they get lost in a snowstorm and are forced to take shelter in the Glensville Sanatorium for the night, where the Hillickers are living. Lauren remembers her brother's stories about the sanatorium and the cannibalistic Hillickers, but her friends don't believe her. As the group goes to bed, Vincent continues to explore the asylum, where he finds Porter's corpse before being killed by Saw Tooth.The next day, with the storm still in full effect, the teens remain trapped and go in search of Vincent. Jenna comes across the Hillickers butchering Porter's body in the kitchen, and runs back to warn the others. After Porter's severed head is thrown at the group, Claire is hung from a balcony with barbed wire by the trio and decapitated. The group attempts to flee the building, but find their snowmobiles have been sabotaged. Lauren skis down the mountain to seek help, while the others barricade themselves in a doctor's office.Kyle, Daniel, and Sara go into the basement to get weapons but Daniel gets abducted, tied to a table in the kitchen, and then slowly eaten alive. The rest of the group chases the cannibals and locks them in a cell; Kyle stays behind to watch them while the others search for spark-plugs for the snowmobiles. When Kyle falls asleep, the brothers escape their cell and the girls accidentally stab Kyle to death after he has his tongue cut out and is dressed up like one of the Hillickers. The cannibals appear and chase the girls through the building, forcing them to climb out of a window; Jenna gets stuck and is impaled with a ground driller by Saw Tooth. The Hillickers chase the girls on the snowmobiles, where Kenia gets injured and Bridget gets crushed under one of them by One Eye.As the day dawns, Lauren has frozen to death in the storm. Kenia is still being chased by One Eye when Sara reappears and knocks him off the snowmobile, allowing the pair to steal it. As they gleefully drive away, they are simultaneously decapitated by a strip of barbed wire.

Article: CARDIFF, Wales Poets, singers and musicians from across the globe gathered in Wales to celebrate the tradition  of storytelling. ""It might seem strange that people still want to listen in age of watching television, but this is an unusual art form whose time has come again,"" said David Ambrose, director of Beyond the Border, an international storytelling festival  in Wales. ""Some of the tales, like those the Inuit from Canada, are thousands years old. So our storytellers have come from distant lands to connect us with the distance of time,"" he said early this month. Two Inuit women, both in their mid 60s, are among the few remaining who can do Kntadjait, or throat singing, which has few words and much sound. Their art is governed by the cold of their surroundings, forcing them to say little but listen attentively. Ambrose started the festival in 1993, after several years of working with those reviving (coming back into use or existence) storytelling in Wales. ""It came out of a group of people who wanted to reconnect with traditions. and as all the Welsh are storytellers, it was _ here."" Ambrose said.

Article: When I opened my e-mail the other day, a pretty woman named Rachel appeared on my computer screen. She greeted me by name and started talking with great enthusiasm . Every now and then she stopped to smile at me or blow a kiss. She was reading to me an e-mail from my brother, and a lot of it was about the trouble he had getting the phone company to give him a high-speed Internet connection. It was pretty cool. Rachel was there thanks to a new technology called Facemail. An ace man lets you send an e-mail that gets ready to the recipient by an attractive male or female from or by a clown . The software, which is free, can be downloaded at www.facemail.com. Facemail faces are lifelike, and they simulate emotions based on emotions-for example, that you put in your text. Type in; -x, and Rachel blows a kiss. Life Fx, the company that develops the Facemail, is sure there are broad business uses. The reason e-business is not popular, the company says, is that buying over the Internet lacks the human touch. But what if you went to the Nike website and Michel Jordan greeted you by name, waited on you and personally closed the sale? And it is talking with Whirlpool about using the technology in a computer screen on a fridge. Then if Mom can't be home when the kids get back from school, she can leave a note with voice and image telling them what there is to eat. Facemail could get hot fast. Personally, I'm a fan. But Facemail should be used with care. The clown looks lively and funny at first. But if you select the clown, put a few rude words in an e-mail and add some angry emotions, you're got Psycho-mail .

review: This place looks like a really expensive restaurant that is classy and upscale...BUT rest assured, it's not that pricey. With that said, I really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant. The moment you walk in you can see how classy and elegant the design of this place is. My wife made reservations for two on a Saturday evening. From the door at the main entrance I was amazed. We walked in, the staff took us to our table and sat us down. We ordered our appetizers and dinner at the same time after taking in the view and deciding from the excellent menu options. To our surprise the dinner and the appetizers came out at the same time. It was weird at first but then all we had to do was request that the appetizers come out before the main course. So that wasn't a big deal for us and we didn't mind at all. The food was very delicious.The restaurant becomes a lounge with good music as the evening progresses. There is a lounge area that has beautiful couches and throw pillows where you can enjoy drinks with friends in a great ambiance. All in all, a great dining experience with great service. The food doesn't deserve a 5 star (maybe a 4 star) but I rate this a 5 star for the experience and feeling that my wife and I felt as we left the restaurant.

Many early immigrant groups traveled to America to worship freely, particularly after the English Civil War and religious conflict in France and Germany. They included nonconformists like the Puritans, who were Protestant Christians fleeing religious persecution from the Anglican King of England. Despite a common background, the groups' views on religious toleration were mixed. While some such as Roger Williams of Rhode Island and William Penn of Pennsylvania ensured the protection of religious minorities within their colonies, others like the Plymouth Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony had established churches. The Dutch colony of New Netherland established the Dutch Reformed Church and outlawed all other worship, though enforcement was sparse.

Background Paragraph: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .

Context: Vein bypass is an essential therapy for patients with advanced peripheral and coronary artery disease despite development of neointimal hyperplasia. We have shown that stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase ephrin type-B receptor 4 (Eph-B4) with its ligand ephrin-B2 prevents neointimal hyperplasia in murine vein grafts. This study determines whether Eph-B4 in adult human veins is capable of phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as functional to release nitric oxide (NO) and prevent neointimal hyperplasia in vitro.', 'Discarded human saphenous veins were taken from the operating room and placed in organ culture without or with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) for 14 days, and the neointima/media ratio was measured in matched veins. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) and examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunoassays, and for release of NO. Ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) was placed on the adventitia of saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress for 24 hours in a bioreactor and activated Eph-B4 examined with immunofluorescence.', 'The baseline intima/media ratio in saphenous vein rings was 0.456 ± 0.097, which increased to 0.726 ± 0.142 in untreated veins after 14 days in organ culture but only to 0.630 ± 0.132 in veins treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (n = 19, P = .017). Ephrin-B2/Fc stimulated Akt, endothelial NO synthase and caveolin-1 phosphorylation, and NO release (P = .007) from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (n = 6). Ephrin-B2/Fc delivered to the adventitia stimulated endothelial Eph-B4 phosphorylation after 24 hours of arterial stress in a bioreactor (n = 3).
Answer: Eph-B4 is present and functional in adult human saphenous veins, with intact downstream signaling pathways capable of NO release and prevention of neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Adventitial delivery of ephrin-B2/Fc activates endothelial Eph-B4 in saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress in vitro. These results suggest that stimulation of Eph-B4 function may be a candidate strategy for translation to human clinical trials designed to inhibit venous neointimal hyperplasia.",https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.244/,,Human,

The Parties agree to make any revisions to this Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto) that are necessary to reflect any New Facility.

Transportation Services. For each Day during the Term, (i) Transporter agrees to provide Firm Service on the Transportation System for Customer Gas delivered to the Transportation System in a quantity not to exceed Customer's Firm Service Gas for such Day, and Interruptible Service for all quantities in excess of Customer's Firm Service Gas for such Day, and deliver to Customer, or for the account of Customer, at the applicable Points of Delivery, Equivalent Quantities of Customer Gas received at the Points of Receipt, and (ii) Customer, or its designee, shall accept such Equivalent Quantities of Customer Gas at the Points of Delivery.   6

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is acknowledged and agreed that there is no minimum amount of Customer Gas that must be delivered to the Transportation System hereunder; accordingly, Customer shall not have any liability (financial or otherwise) for failure to deliver any particular quantity of Gas to Transporter; provided, however, the foregoing sentence shall not reduce or eliminate Customer's obligation to pay the fees provided herein.

Article III. Receipt and Delivery Pressures

Pressure at Point of Receipt. Transporter will receive Customer Gas at the prevailing pressure at which such Customer Gas is delivered to the applicable Point of Receipt by the operator of the applicable Plant.

Pressure at Point of Delivery. All Customer Gas delivered by Transporter will be delivered at the prevailing pressures of the Transportation System as may exist from time to time. Transporter shall at no time be required, unless otherwise agreed in writing, to construct New Facilities or modify the Commencement Date Facilities, including by the addition of compression facilities, to effect such delivery, including, but not limited to, instances in which a facility downstream of a Point of Delivery operates at a pressure in excess of the Transportation System working pressure. For the avoidance of doubt, any New Facilities required by Customer to comply with the operating pressure of facilities located downstream of a Point of Delivery shall be subject to the provisions of Article II.

Article IV. Nominations, Confirmations and Imbalances

Nominations. Each Month during the Term, Customer shall give written notice of Customer's nomination to Transporter specifying the average daily quantity of Customer Gas Customer requests be transported during such Month and designate a person who will be responsible for coordinating notices among Customer, Transporter and Third Party Operators in accordance with these procedures. Customer shall furnish such nomination to Transporter by email or other electronic means and such nomination shall specify such information as is necessary in order to perform the Services requested by Customer. If Customer anticipates any material revision to a Monthly nomination it has provided to Transporter, Customer will notify Transporter as promptly as possible. Transporter will transport hereunder as nearly as practicable at uniform hourly and Daily rates of flow unless otherwise mutually agreed by Customer and Transporter.

Unless otherwise mutually agreed by Customer and Transporter, for Customer's initial nomination to be accepted for the first (1st) Day of any Month, Customer's nomination must be received by Transporter by 11:30 a.m. Central Clock Time on the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the last Day of the Month preceding such Month. Customer shall have the right to submit a new nomination or revise its existing nomination for any Day during such Month provided such nomination is received by Transporter prior to 11:30 a.m. Central Clock Time on the Business Day prior to the Day such new or revised nomination is requested to commence. Customer nominations received by Transporter after 11:30 a.m. Central Clock Time on the Business Day prior to the Day such new or revised service is requested to commence, or intraday nominations   7

for Gas flowing the same Day, may be accepted by Transporter, in its sole discretion. Such new or revised nomination shall specify Customer's anticipated service requirements for the remainder of the applicable Month.

If Customer is advised by a Third Party Operator to reduce or suspend deliveries of Customer Gas to the Transportation System, Customer shall immediately notify Transporter orally of such reduction or suspension, and shall confirm such notification in writing, and adjust its nominations in order to maintain a balanced position to the extent possible.

Confirmations. All nominations of Customer Gas shall be scheduled and implemented by Transporter on a prospective basis and only to the extent Transporter is able to confirm the receipt and delivery of such Gas with the operator(s) of the Point(s) of Delivery. If a conflict arises between Customer's new or revised nomination and an operator's confirmation, Customer understands and agrees such operator's confirmation shall control. If Customer submits a new or revised nomination to Transporter, Transporter will confirm the scheduled quantity to Customer by 3:00 Central Clock Time on the Business Day prior to the Day such new or revised nomination is requested to commence, except for intraday nominations for Gas flowing the same Day, which Transporter will confirm as soon as reasonably practicable.

Commingling. Although Customer shall retain title to Customer Gas delivered to Transporter hereunder, Customer Gas shall constitute part of the supply of Gas from all sources, and as such, Transporter shall, subject to its obligation to deliver Equivalent Quantities each Day, have the right to commingle Customer Gas with Gas of other customers. Transporter shall allocate Customer's pro rata share of each NGL Component contained in any commingled stream of Gas at any Point(s) of Delivery based on the GPMs of each NGL Component contained in Customer's Gas as measured by chromatograph or other method acceptable in the industry at the Point(s) of Receipt.

Imbalances. The term Imbalance means the cumulative difference in a Month between: (i) the quantity of Gas in MMBtu received for the account of Customer at the Point(s) of Receipt, less Customer's System Fuel & LUAF quantity, as applicable, and (ii) the quantity of Gas in MMBtu delivered for the account of Customer at the Point(s) of Delivery. After any adjustment for System Fuel & LUAF, if the Imbalance is the result of receipts at the Point(s) of Receipt exceeding the delivered (or scheduled, as applicable) quantity of Gas for Customer's account at the Point(s) of Delivery, it is a Positive Imbalance. If the Imbalance is a result of receipts at the Point(s) of Receipt being lower than the delivered quantity of Gas for Customer's account at the Point(s) of Delivery, it is a Negative Imbalance. Imbalances will be cashed out on a Monthly basis.   8

Cash Out. The cash-out settlement price will be the monthly arithmetical average of the prices (Cash-out Price) as posted in Gas Daily's Daily Price Survey during the Month under the heading Texas Gas Transmission Corp., under the column labeled Index corresponding to the row labeled Zone 1. Transporter will pay Customer an amount that is the product of the Positive Imbalance each Month, if any, and the Cash-out Price. Customer will pay Transporter an amount that is the product of the Negative Imbalance each Month, if any, and the Cash-out Price. If the actual monthly volume varies by more than five percent (5%) from the delivered volumes for the Month, then the Cash-out Price will be adjusted as follows:



1. For Negative Imbalances, the Cash-out Price will be increased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Point(s) of Delivery volumes and the adjusted Point(s) of Receipt volumes. (i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume from Customer is 7% less than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shall the Cash-Out Price be increased more than 10%; and



2. For Positive Imbalances, the Cash-out Price will be decreased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point, between the Point(s) of Delivery volumes and the adjusted Point(s) of Receipt volumes. (i.e., if the adjusted receipt volume from Customer is 7% greater than the Point(s) of Delivery volume, then the Index Price will be increased by 7%), however in no event shall the Cash-Out Price be increased more than 10%.

Article V. Curtailment

If the quantity of Customer Gas and all other Gas available for delivery into the Transportation System exceeds the capacity of the Transportation System at any point, then Transporter shall interrupt or curtail receipts of Customer Gas with respect to the affected point(s) only in accordance with the following:

(a) First, Transporter shall curtail all Interruptible Service Gas prior to curtailing Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some, but not all, Interruptible Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate the capacity of the Transportation System available for Interruptible Service Gas at the affected points on a pro rata basis based upon Customer's last confirmed nomination of Interruptible Service Gas hereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Interruptible Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the event causing the curtailment.

(b) Second, if additional curtailments are required beyond those described in the immediately preceding clause (a), Transporter shall curtail Firm Service Gas. In the event Transporter curtails some, but not all, Firm Service Gas on a particular Day, Transporter shall allocate the capacity of the Transportation System at the affected point(s) on a pro rata basis based upon Customer's last confirmed nomination of Firm Service Gas hereunder and the last confirmed nominations of Firm Service Gas from all other shippers on the Transportation System prior to the event causing the curtailment.

Transporter shall provide Customer notice of any interruption or curtailment of the receipt of Customer Gas into the Transportation System as is reasonable under the circumstances.

Article VI. Measurement & Testing

The construction, ownership, installation, operation and maintenance of each Measurement Facility that is owned by a Person other than Transporter shall be governed by an interconnect agreement between Transporter and such Person. Each other Measurement Facility shall be constructed, installed, owned, operated and maintained by Transporter.   9

Article VII. Gas Quality

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Customer Gas received at a Point of Receipt from one of the Plants shall be deemed to be in compliance with the applicable Gas quality specifications of the Transportation System.

Article VIII. Fees, Billing & Payment

Fees.

(a) Transportation Fee. For all Customer Gas received by Transporter at a Point of Receipt and delivered to any Point of Delivery, Customer shall pay Transporter a transportation fee of $0.04 per MMBtu.

(b) Other Services Fees. If Transporter provides any compression Services with respect to Customer Gas delivered hereunder, the fees applicable to such Services shall be as mutually agreed between the Parties. The Parties agree to supplement this Agreement with an addendum or other mutually agreeable modification to memorialize the terms applicable to the provision of any such additional Services.

Invoices and Statements. On or before the fifteenth (15th) calendar Day of each Month, Transporter shall provide to Customer an invoice and statement for the previous Month setting forth the calculation of the net amount due hereunder to Transporter for the Services provided hereunder during such previous Month.

Payment of Statements. Within fifteen (15) calendar Days following receipt of each of Transporter's invoices and statements, Customer shall make payment to Transporter of all undisputed amounts by wire transfer, in accordance with the account information provided to Customer, unless another form of payment is agreed to in writing by the Parties. Should Customer fail to make payment in full of all undisputed amounts within such time period, interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the Default Interest Rate or the maximum legal rate, whichever is the lesser, from the date such payment is due until the same is paid. If Customer fails to pay Transporter undisputed amounts due hereunder and such failure is not cured within ten (10) calendar Days' of written notice from Transporter to Customer, Transporter may suspend receipt and delivery of Customer Gas without prejudice to any other available remedies at law or in equity.   10

Billing Disputes. If a good faith dispute arises as to any amount payable hereunder, payment shall nevertheless be made when due of the amount not in dispute. Such payment shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to recoup any overpayment. If Customer withholds payment of any disputed amount, Customer shall, within seven (7) calendar Days after receipt of the statement for the month to which the disputed amount pertains, submit to Transporter a written explanation of the dispute and any available supporting documentation. The Parties shall then cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as expeditiously as possible.

Audit Rights. Each Party or its designated representatives shall, upon reasonable notice to the other Party, have the right, no more frequently than two (2) times per twelve (12) consecutive calendar Months, at its own expense, at reasonable times and during normal business hours, to examine the books and records of such other Party to the extent necessary to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, computation, or demand made under or pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party agrees to keep its records and books in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices in the oil and gas industry. Each invoice and statement shall be final as to both Parties unless questioned in writing within twenty four (24) Months following the date of such invoice or statement.

Article IX. Notices

Any notice, statement, claim or other communication required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be sent by: (i) hand delivery; (ii) United States mail with all postage fully prepaid; or (iii) courier with charges paid in accordance with the customary arrangements established by such courier, in each of the foregoing cases addressed to the Party at the following addresses, and shall be deemed given when received by the Party to whom it is addressed.

Article X. Force Majeure

The term Force Majeure as used herein shall mean acts of God; strikes, lockouts, or other industrial disturbances; conditions arising from a change in governmental laws, orders, rules, or regulations; acts of public enemy; wars; blockades; insurrections; riots; epidemics; landslides; lightning; earthquakes; fires; storms; floods; washouts; arrests and restraints of governments and people; civil disturbances; explosions; breakage or accident to machinery or lines of pipe; the necessity for making repairs, tests, alterations, or performing maintenance to machinery or lines of pipe; scheduled maintenance; freezing of wells or lines of pipe; partial or entire failure of wells, processing, or gasification and gas manufacturing facilities; orders or directives of, or proceedings initiated by, any Governmental Authority; and any other causes, whether of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise, not within the control of the Party claiming relief hereunder, and which by the exercise of due diligence, such Party is unable to prevent or overcome. Such term shall likewise include those instances (a) where either Transporter or Customer is required to obtain servitudes, rights-of-way, grants, permits or licenses to enable such Party to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement and is unable to acquire or experiences delays in acquiring such servitudes, rights-of-way, grants, permits or licenses, at reasonable costs, and after the exercise of reasonable diligence, and (b) the partial or entire failure or refusal of Third Party Operators to receive or deliver Gas, or increases in pressure of upstream or downstream pipelines.

Article XI. Warranties

Customer warrants to Transporter that at the time Customer Gas is delivered to a Point of Receipt hereunder, Customer will have good title or the right to deliver such Customer Gas, and that such Customer Gas shall be free and clear of all liens and adverse claims, other than statutory liens and liens, encumbrances or claims under credit facilities or other credit arrangements in respect of borrowed money. Customer agrees, with respect to the Customer Gas delivered to Transporter hereunder, to indemnify Transporter against all suits, actions, debts, accounts, damages, costs (including attorney's fees), losses and expenses arising from or out of any adverse claims of any and all persons to or against said Customer Gas other than any lien, claim or encumbrance alleged to have arisen by, through or under Transporter or its Affiliate.

Article XIV. Creditworthiness

If Customer has failed to pay any amount when due under this Agreement and if such non-payment is not being disputed in good faith by Customer, Transporter shall have the right to request and receive from Customer adequate assurance of performance (Performance Assurance) which shall mean credit support in a form reasonably acceptable to Transporter and in an amount and for the term reasonably acceptable to Transporter.

(a) An irrevocable standby letter of credit from a bank satisfactory to Transporter;

(b) Provide a prepayment or a deposit in advance of the Month in which Services hereunder are to be provided; or

(c) A performance bond issued by a Person satisfactory to Transporter.

If the credit of Customer's guarantor is satisfactory in Transporter's opinion, a demand for Performance Assurance can be satisfied with a guarantee issued on behalf of Customer in a form acceptable to Transporter, but only for as long as the credit of Customer's guarantor continues to be acceptable to Transporter. Transporter acknowledges and agrees that Memorial Resource Development Corp. is a satisfactory guarantor.

Should Customer or its guarantor fail to provide Performance Assurance within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of written demand for such assurance, then Transporter shall have the right to suspend performance under this Agreement until such time as Customer furnishes Performance Assurance. For the avoidance of doubt, such suspension of performance by Transporter shall not relieve Customer of its obligation to make payments of amounts due hereunder, including, without limitation, payment of fees due hereunder.   14

True, honest, heartfelt masterpiece . W. Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage is one of the best novels I have ever read. The language is simple. The narration is subtle. The characters are real and display emotions and feelings everyone can identify with. The power of novel becomes apparent when you are reading it. You choke up every once a while, you smile for hours after you have finished reading certain passages, and you comprehend your own self, your woes and possibilities, better through perspectives that novel provides.    Philip Carey is born with a clubfoot, and as he grows up, orphaned, he struggles with his own deformity. The initial quarter of the novel is about his growing up, and details incidents and relationships that shape our hero. He then develops a fancy of becoming a painter and travels to Paris, only to quit few years later to return to London, where he studies to become a doctor. The most engrossing part of novel starts here with the entry of Mildred, the waitress.    The rest of the novel thrives on the passion of Philip, his love that carries him to the edge of self-destruction, and his coming of age. Unrequited love has never been potrayed better. Philip allows himself to become an instrument in hands of cold-hearted Mildred, who repeatedly ruins herself through absurd choices, and ruins him for not withstanding his love and care, he finds himself snubbed, ridiculed, bereft. Eventhough his reason tells him otherwise, Philip is unable to release himself from his passion for a considerable time. As is said in the novel, ""But when all was said the important thing was to love rather than to be loved; and he yearned for Mildred with his whole soul.""    The novel is lot more than just story of Philip and Mildred, and there are other unforgettable characters. Each person Philip encounters and each friend he makes, leaves an indelible impression on him and the reader. Be it his idealist friend Hayward, who has too much promise too little product, the poet Cronshaw who dies in poverty, Fenny Price whose hard work cannot make her draw even reasonably well, his uncle and aunt whose love is both tacit and beautifully potrayed and the writer Norah who shows Philip of a caring and loving other.     The most charming people in the novel are Athlneys. Athlney brings life and humor into the novel, and I think saves Philip from a total destruction. The novel really highlights the virtue that lies in a simple, happy married life and Anthlneys win over both Philip and readers with their goodness and simplicity. Thorpe Anthlney with his nine children is a jolly character, and be it his conversations or actions, he wins over our hearts outright.     Philip finds love in most unexpected quarters and is surprised by how help crops up from strangers. His every experience makes him as richer as the reader becomes in reading about it. The thoughts about the meaning of life, or about love or religion or about virtue or vice, and about each aspect of life that Philip encounters are spelt out with a subtlety and mastery. These thoughts find easy resonance with the reader, and make Of Human Bondage an unforgettable affair. The honesty of this piece is stunning. This novel, written without any flourishes and intricate wordplay or mystery, is I think a celebration of the deep insight and understanding of the author.    I have read his other works. The Razor's Edge, The Moon and Six Pence as well as his short stories are a proof of Maugham's ability to tell simple tales with great mastery. These, on their own, make Maugham a great novelist. But it is after reading Of Human Bondage that I realized why most novelists and readers have considered this piece as one the greatest pieces in World Literature. Maugham's aim was perhaps of catharisis and he put his own emotions into the characters, and therefore, he's created a work that is timeless and unforgettable.

"In this task, you are given a review of movie. Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content.
I have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and I would first like to say that I understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well: viewed from an Israeli perspective, I can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie. What I would like to say is that 'Distortion' was shown at a film festival in Geneva in November 2005 (Festival 'Cinéma tout écran') where it won the award of the audience ('Prix du public'in French). For what affects me, I liked the 'nervous camera' work of Mr Bouzaglo, who, in my opinion, portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well, and I think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie. This perspective, however, might seem totally 'alien' to an Israeli viewer, but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers, because Switzerland is a country which has NEVER been subject to any terrorist attack. It therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in Geneva judged this film with a much more 'detached' perspective.I would also like to quote what Mr Bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a Geneva newspaper (I'm translating from French): ''After 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence, we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal.We might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living. We are like the characters in my movie,''on the edge of the edge''. This is the reason why the private detective, who is somehow ''voyeur'' is the happiest character in the movie, because he earns a living thanks to the system, he takes advantage of this situation'' This is, in substance, the main thing that I and the swiss public, in my opinion, pointed out in this movie, and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor. So, to sum up, different country=different perspective, but I think that this is somehow great, because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema, that is to say that it well never be subject to a 'unique' of 'formatted' way of thinking.",https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.244/,,Human,

There are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from King with two bathrooms, Lakeside view or suites. It only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill. You will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return! The staff is nice but when I stay at a hotel I do not go out of my way to seek out the staff. The casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap. Next time I stay in Chicago I will be looking elsewhere.

More than 500 unrelated patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) were screened for mutations in the NF1 gene. For each patient, the whole coding sequence and all splice sites were studied for aberrations, either by the protein truncation test (PTT), temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) of genomic PCR products, or, most often, by direct genomic sequencing (DGS) of all individual exons. A total of 301 sequence variants, including 278 bona fide pathogenic mutations, were identified. As many as 216 or 183 of the genuine mutations, comprising 179 or 161 different ones, can be considered novel when compared to the recent findings of Upadhyaya and Cooper, or to the NNFF mutation database. Mutation-detection efficiencies of the various screening methods were similar: 47.1% for PTT, 53.7% for TGGE, and 54.9% for DGS. Some 224 mutations (80.2%) yielded directly or indirectly premature termination codons. These mutations showed even distribution over the whole gene from exon 1 to exon 47. Of all sequence variants determined in our study, <20% represent C-->T or G-->A transitions within a CpG dinucleotide, and only six different mutations also occur in NF1 pseudogenes, with five being typical C-->T transitions in a CpG. Thus, neither frequent deamination of 5-methylcytosines nor interchromosomal gene conversion may account for the high mutation rate of the NF1 gene. As opposed to the truncating mutations, the 28 (10.1%) missense or single-amino-acid-deletion mutations identified clustered in two distinct regions, the GAP-related domain (GRD) and an upstream gene segment comprising exons 11-17. The latter forms a so-called cysteine/serine-rich domain with three cysteine pairs suggestive of ATP binding, as well as three potential cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) recognition sites obviously phosphorylated by PKA. Coincidence of mutated amino acids and those conserved between human and Drosophila strongly suggest significant functional relevance of this region, with major roles played by exons 12a and 15 and part of exon 16.",https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.244/,,Human,

They have a great carrack which goes there every year and she brings from there every year about six hundred coins: and all this silver of Japan, and two hundred thousand coins more in silver which they bring yearly out of India, they employ to their great advantage in China: and they bring from there gold, musk, silk, copper, porcelains, and many other things very costly and gilded.
When the Portuguese come to Canton in China to traffic, they must remain there but certain days: and when they come in at the gate of the city, they must enter their names in a book, and when they go out at night they must put out their names. They may not lie in the town all night, but must lie in their boats outside of the town. And, their time expired, if any man remains there, he is imprisoned.""
