"This task involves creating questions from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning). 
The generated questions must require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. Try to use a variety of reasoning types in your questions (some of the sample reasoning types are illustrated in the 'positive examples' field) and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates). A span is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. In such questions, the answer spans are recommended to be five words. Questions with answer type ""number"", are expected to start with ""How many"". For instance, ""How long did an event last?"" can be phrased as ""How many years did an event last?"". To increase diversity, try to create more questions for which the answer will be multiple spans. Please create questions that require AT LEAST 2 arithmetic operations as illustrated in the 'positive examples' field. You are encouraged to try DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS of operations and not just limit to the combinations shown in those examples. The more challenging questions you create, the better it is.
Passage: Coming off their road loss to Green Bay, Washington returned home for a duel at FedExField with the Detroit Lions, matching up with them for the first time since 2010, but the first time in DC since 2007. After teams exchanged punts in the first, Washington struck first when Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was intercepted by Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall who returned the interception 9 yards for a 7-0 Washington lead.Detroit responded right away, however, as running back Joique Bell broke numerous tackles on his way to a 12-yard touchdown, evening the score at 7-7. The first quarter would conclude without any further scoring. Early in the second, Detroit finished off a drive with Stafford finding tight end Joseph Fauria for a 5-yard score to give Detroit the 14-7 lead. Later in the second, after a few missed opportunities by both teams, Redskins running back Alfred Morris took off for a 30-yard score, evening the score at 14-14 late in the second. Washington's much-maligned defense, however, could not hold it and Detroit retook the lead before halftime thanks to a David Akers 32-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 17-14 edge and halfway to its first win ever in Washington. Early in the third, Washington was able to equalize with John Potter making his first career field goal from 43 yards out.Both teams failed to score again, and the teams went into the final quarter tied at 17. Early in the fourth, Detroit took the lead again, this time by way of Akers hitting a 28-yard field goal, giving Detroit a 20-17 lead. On Washington's ensuing possession, it appeared as if Washington took the lead, as Robert Griffin III found wide receiver Aldrick Robinson for a 57-yard score and an apparent 24-20 lead. However, upon video replay, it showed Robinson was bobbling the ball as he fell to the ground, thus the apparent pass was ruled incomplete, and Washington could not score again, punting. Detroit marched down the field and all but sealed the deal, as Stafford connected with superstar Calvin Johnson with just under four minutes remaining in the game. Washington didn't give up, however, and John Potter connected from 21 yards out to cut the lead to 27-20. However, after not recovering the onside kick, Washington needed to stop Detroit. They did this, and got the ball back with just under 50 seconds remaining. Washington got to midfield, but Griffin's hail mary pass was off the mark, and Washington lost once again. With the loss. Washington fell to 0-3 for the first time since 2001, and also lost to the Detroit Lions for the third straight time, having not beaten them since 2008 when they didn't even manage to win a single game. However, Washington lost to Detroit at home for the first time since 1935, when they were still the Boston Redskins.

"In this task, you need to provide the parts-of-speech tag of a word present in a sentence specified within curly braces  ( '{{ ... }}' ). The parts-of-speech tags are coarse labels that represent a category of words with similar grammatical properties. The list of part-of-speech tags i.e. tagset of this corpus is 'ADJ': Adjectives are words that typically modify nouns and specify their properties or attributes, 'ADP': Adposition is a cover term for prepositions and postpositions, 'ADV': Adverbs are words that typically modify verbs for such categories as time, place, direction or manner, 'AUX': An auxiliary is a function word that accompanies the lexical verb of a verb phrase and expresses grammatical distinctions not carried by the lexical verb, such as person, number, tense, mood, aspect, voice or evidentiality, 'CCONJ': A coordinating conjunction is a word that links words or larger constituents without syntactically subordinating one to the other and expresses a semantic relationship between them, 'DET': Determiners are words that modify nouns or noun phrases and express the reference of the noun phrase in context, 'INTJ': An interjection is a word that is used most often as an exclamation or part of an exclamation, 'NOUN': Nouns are a part of speech typically denoting a person, place, thing, animal or idea, 'NUM': A numeral is a word, functioning most typically as a determiner, adjective or pronoun, that expresses a number and a relation to the number, such as quantity, sequence, frequency or fraction, 'PART': Particles are function words that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning and that do not satisfy definitions of other universal parts of speech, 'PRON': Pronouns are words that substitute for nouns or noun phrases, whose meaning is recoverable from the linguistic or extralinguistic context, 'PROPN': A proper noun is a noun (or nominal content word) that is the name (or part of the name) of a specific individual, place, or object, 'PUNCT': Punctuation marks are non-alphabetical characters and character groups used in many languages to delimit linguistic units in printed text, 'SCONJ': A subordinating conjunction is a conjunction that links constructions by making one of them a constituent of the other. The subordinating conjunction typically marks the incorporated constituent which has the status of a (subordinate) clause, 'SYM': A symbol is a word-like entity that differs from ordinary words by form, function or both, 'VERB': A verb is a member of the syntactic class of words that typically signal events and actions, can constitute a minimal predicate in a clause, and govern the number and types of other constituents which may occur in the clause, 'X': The tag X is used for words that for some reason cannot be assigned a real part-of-speech category.

"In this task you are expected to fix an SQL query based on feedback. You will be given an SQL statement and an English description with what is wrong about that SQL statement. You must correct the SQL statement based off of the feedback. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

I had a chemistry test coming up. I didn't do so well on the first one. Now is my chance to prove I can do well. I study for a week straight. 4+ hours every day. And i get a 65%. In the car, my dad asks about it. I say I got a 65, which was better than last time, and not an F but a D, and I got my last exam score (55%) replaced with this one. Dad asks what I have in thr class, and I say 75%.    Mom says ""you might want to rethink being a chem major if you can't do community college level chemistry."" I'm 17, in high school, and I'm going to a local community college through a program my school offers. She has already brought it up before, and I was really doubting myself. I just say ""haha yeah.."" because I don't really know what else to say. Its been hard motivating myself and finding a goal I want to achieve, but being a biochem major and getting my bachelors degree in Science is the one goal I've made for myself. Its what I've been working with in mind for the last 2 years at this college. I almost have my Associates. And now my mom is telling me I can't achieve my goal.     My dad says ""no no she can do it, it will take a little work, but she can do it. Everything takes work."" I don't say anything because I don't want my mom to keep going on about it. Last time she talked about this, I was in the car by myself with her, so I just had to sit and listen to her tell me I'm not good at chemistry, wasn't in high school, isn't now, and why do I want to be a chem major when I'm bad at chemistry. But I felt better about having my dad in the car because he usually says something when my mom goes too far with something.     She always used to ask me why I don't have any goals in life, why I don't care. Because whenever I have something I love doing or something I want to work towards, you always walk all over me and make me question whether or not I can do it, whether or not I can do anything.       When I was applying to universities, she said I could apply anywhere, that now was my time to start becoming more mature. She always goes on about how college is my time, my time to do what I want, be who I want to be, and how I can go anywhere.     I said I wanted to apply to UW Seattle.     Yes, perfect!     I guess I can apply to UW Tacoma too. No, you are not applying there!     Why not, it has a small school size which is what I want, it's still University of Washington thats the one school I have always dreamed of going to every since I was a kid.     Because, you are not applying there!!!    I want to apply to both UW's with dorms I've always wanted to go there, XXX (my boyfriend) is going there too!     You know you're not going to be with him when you're in college right, you're not going to be together very long, you know you're not getting married, right? You're going to meet so many new people in college, you think he's not going to meet any new people while he's in college? He's probably met people already (he's a college freshman this year).    She always asks if I have crushes on any of my male friends. Asks if I feel anything for them. If there's something between us. I don't understand why. She's not joking. She's being completely serious. It just makes me uncomfortable. And always makes comments about my boyfriend finding someone else to be with at work or at college.    As I was showing her my prom dress, she said,    Maybe you'll get to wear it in college, some guy might invite you out to a fancy event!    I'm going to prom with my boyfriend and I have never been more exited to go to a school event. I've never gone to school dances, events, anything. But my boyfriend wanted to share a special day with me, and that's what my mom had to say about it.     I wish she could recognize that I'm happy with him, and even though I know it may not last forever, I can hope it will and appreciate the present.

review: This place looks like a really expensive restaurant that is classy and upscale...BUT rest assured, it's not that pricey. With that said, I really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant. The moment you walk in you can see how classy and elegant the design of this place is. My wife made reservations for two on a Saturday evening. From the door at the main entrance I was amazed. We walked in, the staff took us to our table and sat us down. We ordered our appetizers and dinner at the same time after taking in the view and deciding from the excellent menu options. To our surprise the dinner and the appetizers came out at the same time. It was weird at first but then all we had to do was request that the appetizers come out before the main course. So that wasn't a big deal for us and we didn't mind at all. The food was very delicious.The restaurant becomes a lounge with good music as the evening progresses. There is a lounge area that has beautiful couches and throw pillows where you can enjoy drinks with friends in a great ambiance. All in all, a great dining experience with great service. The food doesn't deserve a 5 star (maybe a 4 star) but I rate this a 5 star for the experience and feeling that my wife and I felt as we left the restaurant.

"Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

"For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"This task involves creating questions from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning). 
The generated questions must require looking at more than one part of the passage to answer. Try to use a variety of reasoning types in your questions (some of the sample reasoning types are illustrated in the 'positive examples' field) and also have a variety of answer types (spans, numbers, dates). A span is a continuous phrase taken directly from the passage or question. In such questions, the answer spans are recommended to be five words. Questions with answer type ""number"", are expected to start with ""How many"". For instance, ""How long did an event last?"" can be phrased as ""How many years did an event last?"". To increase diversity, try to create more questions for which the answer will be multiple spans. Please create questions that require AT LEAST 2 arithmetic operations as illustrated in the 'positive examples' field. You are encouraged to try DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS of operations and not just limit to the combinations shown in those examples. The more challenging questions you create, the better it is. 
input : Passage: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Patriots, the Raiders stayed at home for a Week 16 duel with the Houston Texans.  Oakland would get the early lead in the first quarter as quarterback JaMarcus Russell completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Chaz Schilens.  The Texans would respond with fullback Vonta Leach getting a 1-yard touchdown run, yet the Raiders would answer with kicker Sebastian Janikowski getting a 33-yard and a 30-yard field goal.  Houston would tie the game in the second quarter with kicker Kris Brown getting a 53-yard and a 24-yard field goal. Oakland would take the lead in the third quarter with wide receiver Johnnie Lee Higgins catching a 29-yard touchdown pass from Russell, followed up by an 80-yard punt return for a touchdown.  The Texans tried to rally in the fourth quarter as Brown nailed a 40-yard field goal, yet the Raiders' defense would shut down any possible attempt.

Context: Vein bypass is an essential therapy for patients with advanced peripheral and coronary artery disease despite development of neointimal hyperplasia. We have shown that stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase ephrin type-B receptor 4 (Eph-B4) with its ligand ephrin-B2 prevents neointimal hyperplasia in murine vein grafts. This study determines whether Eph-B4 in adult human veins is capable of phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways, as well as functional to release nitric oxide (NO) and prevent neointimal hyperplasia in vitro.', 'Discarded human saphenous veins were taken from the operating room and placed in organ culture without or with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) for 14 days, and the neointima/media ratio was measured in matched veins. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) and examined with quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunoassays, and for release of NO. Ephrin-B2/Fc (2 μg/mL) was placed on the adventitia of saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress for 24 hours in a bioreactor and activated Eph-B4 examined with immunofluorescence.', 'The baseline intima/media ratio in saphenous vein rings was 0.456 ± 0.097, which increased to 0.726 ± 0.142 in untreated veins after 14 days in organ culture but only to 0.630 ± 0.132 in veins treated with ephrin-B2/Fc (n = 19, P = .017). Ephrin-B2/Fc stimulated Akt, endothelial NO synthase and caveolin-1 phosphorylation, and NO release (P = .007) from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (n = 6). Ephrin-B2/Fc delivered to the adventitia stimulated endothelial Eph-B4 phosphorylation after 24 hours of arterial stress in a bioreactor (n = 3).
Answer: Eph-B4 is present and functional in adult human saphenous veins, with intact downstream signaling pathways capable of NO release and prevention of neointimal hyperplasia in vitro. Adventitial delivery of ephrin-B2/Fc activates endothelial Eph-B4 in saphenous veins treated with arterial shear stress in vitro. These results suggest that stimulation of Eph-B4 function may be a candidate strategy for translation to human clinical trials designed to inhibit venous neointimal hyperplasia.",https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.244/,8,9,6,10,8,7,8,7,2,4,1,2,9,8,9,8,10,9,10,9,10

"In this task you will break down a question into the basic steps required to answer it.
 A question decomposition is a numbered list of operations that must be performed to answer the original question. Imagine explaining your question to a friendly droid by listing each action it should take in order for the question to be answered. Each step in our decomposition should refer to either an entity (known or unknown), a propery of an entity or a query operation (count, group, union, etc.)
 Here are the list of step templates and their description:
 Select: A select step is used to return a set of objects. There are no references to previous steps in a select step. template: Return [attributes]
 Filter: A filter step is used to return results from a previous step to which a certain condition applies. template: Return [#step] [condition]
 Project: A project step should return certain attributes of the results of a previous step. template: Return [attributes] of [#step]
 Aggregate: An aggregate step returns an aggregator function applied on a step's result. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step].
 Group: A group step is an aggregator applied on attributes. template: Return the [aggregator] of [#step] for each [attribute]
 Superlative: A superlative step is used to return the result with a highest/lowest attribute among other results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [is] [highest / lowest]
 Comparative: A comparative step is used when we need to compare an attribute with a number to filter results. template: Return [#step1] [where] [#step2] [comparator] [number] 
 Union: A union step is used to return results of two steps together. template: Return [#step1] [or / ,] [#step2]
 Intersection: An intersection step returns the result that two steps have in common. template: Return [attribute] of both [#step1] and [#step2]
 Discard: A discard step returns result of a step and excludes result of another step from it. template: Return [#step1] besides [#step2]
 Sort: A sort returns result of another step in a specific order. template: Return [#step1] [ordered / sorted by] [#step2]
 Is true: An is true step checks a condition on another result and returns a true or false. template: Return [is / if] [condition]
 Arithmetic: An arithmatic step operates an arithmatic operation on one or more steps. template: Return the [arithmetic op.] of [#step1] [and] [#step2].

"For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the ""SELECT"" statement. Next, you use a ""FROM"" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the ""AS"" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the ""AS"" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the ""JOIN"" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the ""ON"" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the ""WHERE"" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The ""GROUP BY"" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The ""HAVING"" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the ""ORDER BY"" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The ""DESC"" statement will sort in descending order and the ""ASC"" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the ""LIMIT"" statement to return a certain number of rows. When ""*"" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

"Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

"In the following task, you are given a yes/no question, its answer, and additional information which includes a description of a key term in the question and several facts. Your task is to ""decompose the question""i.e. write the steps required to construct the given answer where each step is a question that can be answered using Wikipedia articles. To decompose the question, think of a decomposition strategy you could apply to answer the question through a search against Wikipedia. The decomposition strategy might not be obvious for some questions. For this reason, you are provided with additional information. You are not required to write decompositions that exactly match the provided facts, they are only meant as guidance. If the facts are too noisy, think about how you would have used Wikipedia to answer this question to create the decomposition. ""not_definitive_answer"" is true if there is no clear answer i.e. the question is ambiguous or a subjective opinion.""incorrect_answer"" is true if the answer to the question is not correct. If the answer is incorrect, write a decomposition that evaluates the correct answer. Each question should be easy to answer based on simple facts from Wikipedia pages, or a simple check using the answers to preceding questions. To ensure this, we also ask you to enter a potential Wikipedia article that would contain the answer to each question. If you can not think of a Wikipedia page that can answer your question, please think of a different strategy. You do not need to enter a Wikipedia page for steps that don't add new information and only contain simple checks. The answer to the final question is the same as the answer to the original question. Every question's answer has an impact on the final answer and there should be no redundant steps in the decomposition.
